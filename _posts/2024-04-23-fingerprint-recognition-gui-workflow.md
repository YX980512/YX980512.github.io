# Fingerprint Recognition GUI Development

Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for fingerprint recognition involves a blend of software development, user experience design, and the integration of biometric processing algorithms. This post outlines the workflow and some challenges encountered while creating a fingerprint recognition GUI.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before diving into GUI design, setting up a proper development environment is crucial. For this project, I chose Python due to its rich ecosystem of libraries. The primary packages included `tkinter` for the GUI and `sqlite3` for database management. Additionally, I employed a custom class `FingerprintProcessor` that wrapped the functionality derived from a Jupyter notebook used for fingerprint comparison.

## GUI Design and Functionality

### Initial Interface

The first step was to design the main window of the application. The interface needed to be intuitive and straightforward, allowing users to:

- Enter their name.
- Enroll their fingerprint via a file dialog.
- View a list of already registered fingerprints.

### Real-Time Feedback

An essential feature was to provide real-time feedback during the fingerprint enrollment process. Using a secondary window, the `RealtimeResultsDialog`, users could see the similarity scores as their fingerprint was compared against the database, fostering transparency and trust in the system.

## Database Integration

Each enrolled fingerprint, along with the user's name, was stored in an SQLite database. Managing data efficiently was crucial, ensuring fast retrieval and no duplication of fingerprints.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```
