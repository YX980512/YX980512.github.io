# Unveiling Deep Learning from the Foundations Course

## A New Course on Deep Learning Mastery

I'm excited to announce the release of "Deep Learning from the Foundations", a new course that empowers you to build state-of-the-art deep learning models from the ground up. This course is not just about learning what's practical, but about understanding the why and how, equipping you with the knowledge to navigate the fast-paced advancements of deep learning.

## Course Composition

Taught by Jeremy Howard, this course unfolds the intricacies of deep learning through hands-on Python coding, covering seminal papers, and exploring the powerful fastai library and PyTorch. It culminates in cutting-edge topics, taught with the code-first approach that fast.ai is renowned for.

## What’s Inside?

- **Matrix Multiplication:** The building block of neural networks.
- **Forward and Backward Passes:** Dive into the mechanics of learning.
- **Loss Functions and Optimizers:** The driving forces of model training.
- **The Data Block API:** A cornerstone of fastai’s usability.
- **Advanced Training Techniques:** From mixed-precision training to ULMFiT.

## Beyond Python

Venture into Swift for TensorFlow, alongside Chris Lattner, and explore this language’s growing significance in deep learning. Understand Swift's interop with C for peak performance and get hands-on with the Swift version of fastai.
