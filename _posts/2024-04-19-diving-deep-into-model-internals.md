# Diving Deep into Model Internals with Lesson 10

Deep learning models often feel like black boxes. In Lesson 10 of 'Deep Learning from the Foundations,' I cracked open that box. My exploration centered on callbacks, event handlers, and PyTorch hooks, leading to a rich understanding of model internals, particularly within the ResNet18 architecture.

## Callbacks: The Puppeteers of Python

Callbacks are intriguing. They are like invisible puppeteers controlling the flow of a program. This lesson dissected their anatomy, demonstrating how to harness Python's special `__dunder__` methods to craft objects with behaviors mimicking built-in types—powerful indeed!

## Mastery Through Experimentation

Armed with this knowledge, I ventured into the depths of the ResNet18 model. PyTorch hooks became my torchlight here. They revealed how data flowed through the network, providing a real-time map of activation distributions. It was like watching the neurons firing and talking, a truly profound sight.

## Observations and Adjustments

Through this lens, the quirks of training became more apparent. I saw the occasional flat-lining in the activation histograms—a signal of dying ReLU syndrome perhaps? Switching to Leaky ReLU introduced life back into the model, evidenced by the revived distributions.

Batch normalization (BatchNorm) was the next stop. Its promise to accelerate training was alluring but not without its caveats. In practice, I observed its struggles with small batch sizes—a case where Group Normalization offered a better alternative.

## Encouraging Results and Forward Thinking

Experimenting with these normalization techniques was not just an exercise—it was a transformation of knowledge into practice. By the time I introduced a new normalization layer and compared it to established norms, the results were not just numbers. They were a testament to an enriched understanding, an evolution from theory to application.

## Reflections

What began as a course lesson transcended into a journey through the neural pathways of deep learning. Observing the ResNet18 model's structure, tinkering with it, and seeing the impact unfold in training was a powerful reminder of why I love this field. There's magic in the mechanics, and Lesson 10 was the perfect guide to this arcane knowledge.

If you're embarking on a similar journey, remember—look inside the model. The insights you gain will illuminate your path and shape your understanding of deep learning's foundations.
